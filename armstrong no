//ALGORITHM 
Step 1: Get number by user
Step 2: Get the modulus/remainder of the number
Step 3: sum the remainder of the number
Step 4: Divide the number by 10
Step 5: Repeat the step 2 while number is greater than 0

//PROGRAM BELOW
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int number, originalNumber, remainder, result = 0;
    printf("Enter a three digit integer: ");
    scan("%d", &number);
    originalNumber = number;
    while (originalNumber != 0)
    {
        remainder = originalNumber%10;
        result += remainder*remainder*remainder;
        originalNumber /= 10;
    }
    if(result == number)
        printf("%d is an Armstrong number.",number);
    else
        printf("%d is not an Armstrong number.",number);
