//ALGORITHM 
Step 1: Get number by user
Step 2: Get the modulus/remainder of the number
Step 3: sum the remainder of the number
Step 4: Divide the number by 10
Step 5: Repeat the step 2 while number is greater than 0

# Python program to check if the number is an Armstrong number or not

# take input from the user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# initialize sum
sum = 0

# find the sum of the cube of each digit
temp = num
while temp > 0:
   digit = temp % 10
   sum += digit ** 3
   temp //= 10

# display the result
if num == sum:
   print(num,"is an Armstrong number")
else:
   print(num,"is not an Armstrong number")
